# Night Vision Monocular Device

## Intro

This project is a DIY night-vision monocular built from a RunCam Night Eagle 3 v2 analog camera and a small OLED display in a custom 3D‑printed housing. The case is designed to mount either on a head harness or on any Picatinny rail, making it usable as a helmet-mounted NVG or a simple rail-mounted viewer. It works with any IR torch or illuminator, is cheap and easy to assemble from off‑the‑shelf parts, and because the signal path is fully analog, latency is extremely low—so you can wear it for long periods without the motion sickness or headaches common with digital solutions.

## Troubleshooting

The camera itself can get quite hot to the touch, if encased in PLA, it can melt the casing after while. The solution for this is to make the housing from aluminium with CNC. Mount the camera in the aluminium case and use thermal paste to make contact with it for better heat trasfer.
